        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>We at Ray Cammack Shows, Inc., Inc. (“Ray Cammack Shows, Inc.,” “we,” “us,” or “our”)
            have created this privacy policy (this “Privacy Policy”) because we know that you care
            about how information you provide to us is used and shared. This Privacy Policy relates
            to the information collection and use practices of Ray Cammack Shows, Inc. in connection
            with our Direct ordering Platform, Discover marketplace Platform and our other Services.
        </p>

        <p>By using our Services, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the
            accompanying Terms of Service.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning set forth in
            our Terms of Service.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When you provide us with any Personal Information (as defined below), you consent to Ray
            Cammack Shows, Inc.’s collection, use, disclosure, and retention of your information in
            accordance with this Privacy Policy and as otherwise permitted by law.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</p>
        <p>1. PERSONAL INFORMATION</p>
        <p>When you sign up to become a Registered User or enter a promotion or our referral
            program, you may be required to provide us with personal information about yourself,
            such as your name, address, phone number, and e-mail address (collectively, the
            “Personal Information”). We do not collect any Personal Information from you when you
            use our Services unless you provide us with the Personal Information voluntarily (for
            example, by registering to use the Services or joining our e-mail list).</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>2. BILLING INFORMATION</p>
        <p>In order to submit orders through the Platform, you will be required to provide certain
            information in addition to the Personal Information noted above. Such information may
            include a debit card number, credit card number, billing address, and similar
            information (collectively, the “Billing Information”).</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>3. GEOLOCATIONAL INFORMATION</p>
        <p>In order to provide access to the Services while you are using a mobile device, we
            automatically collect geolocational information from your mobile device, your wireless

            Collection of such Geolocational Information occurs only when the Services are running
            on your mobile device. You may control the collection of Geolocational Information
            through the user settings on your device. You may decline to allow us to collect such
            Geolocational Information, in which case Ray Cammack Shows, Inc. will not be able to
            provide certain services to you. Please be sure to manage your mobile device and privacy
            preferences on the Platform on an ongoing basis.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>4. OTHER INFORMATION</p>
        <p>In addition to the Personal Information, the Billing Information, and the Geolocational
            Information, we may collect additional information regarding you and your use of our
            Services, your interactions with us and our advertising, as well as information
            regarding your computer or other devices used to access our Services (collectively, the

            version (for example iOS, Android or Windows), your carrier and network type (WiFi, 3G,
            4G, LTE); (ii) your IP addresses (which may consist of a static or dynamic IP address

            Services.</p>
        <p>From Cookies. Information that we collect using “cookie” technology. Cookies are small
            packets of data that a website stores on your computer’s hard drive so that your
            computer will “remember” information about your visit. We use cookies to help us collect
            Other Information and to enhance your experience using the Services. Specifically, we
            use cookies to authenticate users, personalize your experience when using the Services,
            analyze which features of the Services you use most frequently, and measure and optimize
            advertising and promotional effectiveness. To do this, we may use both session cookies,
            which expire once you close your web browser, and persistent cookies, which stay on your
            computer until you delete them. If you do not want the Services to place a cookie on
            your hard drive, you may be able to turn that feature off on your computer or mobile
            device. Please consult your Internet browser’s documentation for information on how to
            do this. However, if you decide not to accept cookies from us, the Services may not
            function properly. When the Services are made available to you through Facebook (via our
            Plugin) and/or other third-party sites, please be aware that these other sites maintain
            their own policies regarding cookies and the collection and use of information. You are
            responsible for reviewing those policies.</p>
        <p>From Other Sources. Information that we collect or receive from Facebook and/or other
            sites on which you have used the Services in accordance with their terms of use and
            privacy policies and applicable law.</p>
        <p>Third-Party Analytics. We use third-party analytics services (such as Google Analytics)
            to evaluate your use of the Services, compile reports on activity, collect demographic
            data, analyze performance metrics, and collect and evaluate other information relating
            to the Services and mobile and Internet usage. These third parties use cookies and other
            technologies to help analyze and provide us the data. By accessing and using the
            Services, you consent to the processing of data about you by these analytics providers
            in the manner and for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. The information used
            by such analytics services is generally at the aggregate level. To the extent any such
            information is at the individual level or is used for secondary marketing purposes,
            Canadian users may opt-out of such collection or use by sending an e-mail to
            <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="6d04030b022d1f0e1e0b180343430e0200">[email&#160;protected]</a> or writing to us at:</p>

            collection, please visit https://www.google.com/analytics. Please be advised that if you
            opt out of any service, you may not be able to use the full functionality of the
            Services.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>THE INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH THIRD–PARTY ADVERTISING COMPANIES</p>
        <p>We share Other Information about your activity in connection with your use of the
            Services with third parties for the purpose of tailoring, analyzing, managing,
            reporting, and optimizing advertising you see on the Platform, the Website, the Apps,
            the Plugin, and elsewhere. These third parties may use cookies, pixel tags (also called
            web beacons or clear gifs), and/or other technologies to collect such Other Information
            for such purposes. Pixel tags enable us, and these third-party advertisers, to recognize
            a browser’s cookie when a browser visits the site on which the pixel tag is located in
            order to learn which advertisement brings a user to a given site. By using the Services,
            you consent to this collection.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>ACCESSING AND MODIFYING PERSONAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION PREFERENCES</p>

            Personal Information, Billing Information, and certain Other Information by following
            the instructions found on the Website, our ordering widget on a restaurant’s website, a
            Restaurant App, or the Ray Cammack Shows, Inc. App. In addition, you may manage your
            receipt of marketing and non-transactional communications by clicking on the
            “unsubscribe” link located on the bottom of any Ray Cammack Shows, Inc. marketing email.
            Registered Users cannot opt out of receiving transactional e-mails related to their
            account. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to process such requests in a
            timely manner. You should be aware, however, that it is not always possible to
            completely remove or modify information in our subscription databases. In such case, we
            will provide you the reason why the modification or removal was not possible.</p>

            and those of our third-party marketing partners, to administer our rewards, referral,

            Information to process your orders, and we use the Geolocational Information to

            Information, Geolocational Information, and/or Other Information as described below.</p>

            order, and, if you are ordering for delivery, your physical address with the restaurants
            from which you order and with any third parties that are involved in, or provide
            services in connection with, such orders, such as delivery services, licensees of our
            Platform, and similar parties. Such parties will use such information in accordance with
            the terms of their privacy policies.</p>
        <p>In order to administer our rewards, referral, and promotional programs, we may share your
            Personal Information and Other Information with the restaurants from which you order and
            delivery services that deliver your orders.</p>
        <p>We may from time to time share Personal Information and/or Other Information with other
            companies who may provide you information about the products and services they offer.
            However, to the extent required by law, you will be given the opportunity to opt-out of
            such sharing.</p>
        <p>In an ongoing effort to better understand our users and our Services, we might analyze
            the Other Information and the Geolocational Information in aggregate form in order to
            operate, maintain, manage, and improve the Services. This aggregate information does not
            identify you personally. We may share this aggregate data with our affiliates, agents,
            and business partners. We may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to
            describe our products and services to current and prospective business partners and to
            other third parties for other lawful purposes.</p>
        <p>We may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.
            Examples may include providing marketing assistance, order fulfillment, billing, and
            customer service. These other companies will have access to the Personal Information,
            the Billing Information, the Geolocational Information, and the Other Information only
            as necessary to perform their functions and to the extent permitted by law.</p>
        <p>As we develop our businesses, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of
            a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, sale of assets, dissolution, or similar event,
            the Personal Information, Billing Information, Geolocational Information, and Other
            Information may be part of the transferred assets.</p>
        <p>To the extent permitted by law, we may also disclose Personal Information, the Billing
            Information, the Geolocational Information, and the Other Information when required by
            law, court order, or other government or law enforcement authority or regulatory agency,
            or whenever we believe that disclosing such information is necessary or advisable, for
            example, to protect the rights, property, or safety of Ray Cammack Shows, Inc. or
            others.</p>
        <p>We will take reasonable measures to require that the party receiving any of your Personal
            Information undertakes to: (i) retain and use such information only for the purposes set
            out in this Privacy Policy; (ii) not disclose your Personal Information except with your

        <p>We take commercially reasonable steps to protect the Personal Information, the Billing
            Information, the Geolocational Information, and the Other Information from loss, misuse,
            and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Please understand,
            however, that no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of
            our databases, nor can we guarantee that the information you supply will not be
            intercepted while being transmitted to and from us over the Internet. In particular,

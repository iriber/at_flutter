        <p>The following terms apply when you download the Ray Cammack Shows, Inc. App and/or any of
            the Restaurant Apps (collectively, the “Apps”) from Apple’s App Store. These terms are
            in addition to all other terms contained in the Agreement.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You acknowledge and agree that (i) the Agreement is concluded between you and Ray Cammack
            Shows, Inc. only, and not Apple; and (ii) Ray Cammack Shows, Inc., not Apple, is solely
            responsible for the Apps and content thereof. Your use of the Apps must comply with the
            App Store Terms of Service.</p>
        <p>You acknowledge that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and
            support services with respect to the Apps.</p>
        <p>In the event of any failure of any of the Apps to conform to any applicable warranty, you
            may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price, if any, for the applicable
            App to you and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no
            other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the App. As between Ray Cammack
            Shows, Inc. and Apple, any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs, or
            expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be the sole

        <p>You acknowledge that, in the event of any third-party claim that the Apps or your

            as between Ray Cammack Shows, Inc. and Apple, Ray Cammack Shows, Inc., not Apple, will
            be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement, and discharge of any
            such intellectual property infringement claim to the extent required by the Agreement.

            beneficiaries of the Agreement as related to your license of the Apps, and that, upon
            your acceptance of the terms and conditions of the Agreement, Apple, will have the right
            (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce the Agreement as related to
            your license of the Apps against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof.</p>
        <p>17. BINDING ARBITRATION</p>
        <p>In the event of a dispute arising under or relating to this Agreement or the Services or
            any other products or services provided by us (each, a “Dispute”), either party may
            elect to finally and exclusively resolve the dispute by binding arbitration governed by
            the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”). Any election to arbitrate, at any time, shall be
            final and binding on the other party. IF EITHER PARTY CHOOSES ARBITRATION, NEITHER PARTY
            SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIM IN COURT OR TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL. DISCOVERY
            AND APPEAL RIGHTS MAY ALSO BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION. All disputes will be resolved
            before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for a limited right of
            appeal under the FAA. Any court in Los Angeles, California may enforce the arbitrator’s
            award. The arbitration shall be administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation
            Services (“JAMS”) pursuant to JAMS’ Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, if
            applicable, or otherwise pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures
            and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those Rules (the “JAMS Rules”). Such
            disputes will be resolved by the arbitrator as determined under the JAMS Rules. The
            arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or
            online. If conducted in person, the arbitration shall take place in Los Angeles,
            California. The parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding
            pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award
            entered by the arbitrator. In addition, we may bring an action for injunctive relief in
            any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>18. CLASS ACTION WAIVER</p>
        <p>You agree that any arbitration or proceeding shall be limited to the Dispute between us
            and you individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (i) no arbitration or
            proceeding shall be joined with any other; (ii) there is no right or authority for any
            Dispute to be arbitrated or resolved on a class action-basis or to utilize class action
            procedures; and (iii) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a
            purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.
            YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST US ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT
            AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>19. MISCELLANEOUS</p>
        <p>You expressly acknowledge and agree that this Agreement is formed in the State of
            California. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
            domestic laws of the State of California, without giving effect to its principles of
            conflicts of laws. If this Agreement is terminated in accordance with the Termination
            provision above, such termination shall not affect the validity of the following
            provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect: “Payment;
            Refunds,” “Deliveries,” “Intellectual Property,” “Communications to Ray Cammack Shows,
            Inc.,” “No Warranties/Limitation of Liability,” “Indemnification,” “Termination of the
            Agreement,” “Binding Arbitration,” “Class Action Waiver,” and “Miscellaneous.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Our failure to act on or enforce any provision of the Agreement shall not be construed as
            a waiver of that provision or any other provision in this Agreement. No waiver shall be
            effective against us unless made in writing, and no such waiver shall be construed as a
            waiver in any other or subsequent instance. Except as expressly agreed by us and you in
            writing, this Agreement constitutes the entire Agreement between you and us with respect
            to the subject matter, and supersedes all previous or contemporaneous agreements,
            whether written or oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter. The
            section headings are provided merely for convenience and shall not be given any legal
            import. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of our successors, assigns, licensees,
            and sublicensees.</p>
